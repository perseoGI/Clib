# Clib

This is a custom C library which implements some data structures every language should have but, of course, C dont.

## Linked List

Doble linked list implementation, allowing FIFO, LIFO, or other combinations.


## Hash Map

Hash Map implementation, allowing low complexity access.

### To Be Done

- Create unit test for all public and private functions
- Add new data structures:
    + FIFO wrapper
    + LIFO wrapper
    + TODO
- Analyze hash_code efficincy
- Improve hash_code function to avoid hash collisions
- Improve README
